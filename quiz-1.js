Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area. Each AWS Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. Availability Zones in a region are connected with low latency, high throughput, and highly redundant networking. These Availability Zones offer AWS customers an easier and more effective way to design and operate applications and databases, making them more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single datacenter infrastructures or multi-datacenter infrastructures.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to replicating applications and data across multiple data centers in the same Region using Availability Zones, you can also choose to increase redundancy and fault tolerance further by replicating data between geographic Regions (especially if you are serving customers from all over the world).

What does AWS provide to help organize them into teams and then assign the appropriate permissions for each team?</p>","relatedLectureIds":"","feedbacks":["","","",""],"explanation":"<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users that are managed as a unit. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. For example, you could have a user group called Admins and give that user group the types of permissions that administrators typically need. Any user in that user group automatically has the permissions that are assigned to the user group. If a new user joins your organization and needs administrator privileges, you can assign the appropriate permissions by adding the user to that user group. Similarly, if a person changes jobs in your organization, instead of editing that user's permissions, you can remove him or her from the old user groups and add him or her to the appropriate new user groups.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"IAM role\"&nbsp;is incorrect. </em></strong>An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. IAM roles allow you to delegate access (for a limited time) to users or services that normally don't have access to your organization's AWS resources. IAM users or AWS services can assume a role to obtain temporary security credentials that can be used to interact with specific AWS resources.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don't normally have access to your AWS resources. For example, you might want to grant users in your AWS account access to resources they don't usually have, or grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another account. Or you might want to allow a mobile app to use AWS resources, but not want to embed AWS keys within the app. Sometimes you want to give AWS access to users who already have identities defined outside of AWS, such as in your corporate directory. Or, you might want to grant access to your account to third parties so that they can perform an audit on your resources. For these scenarios, you can delegate access to AWS resources using an IAM role.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"IAM users\"&nbsp;is incorrect. </em></strong>An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to directly interact with AWS. A primary use for IAM users is to give people the ability to sign in to the AWS Management Console for interactive tasks and to make programmatic requests to AWS services using the API or CLI. A user in AWS consists of a name, a password to sign into the AWS Management Console, and up to two access keys that can be used with the API or CLI. When you create an IAM user, you grant it permissions by making it a member of a user group that has appropriate permission policies attached (recommended), or by directly attaching policies to the user.</p><p><br></p><p>Additional information:</p><p>An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone (or any service, application, ...etc) who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session. IAM roles are meant to be assumed by authorized entities, such as IAM users, applications, or an AWS service such as Amazon EC2.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"AWS Organizations\" is incorrect. </em></strong>AWS Organizations can be used to group AWS accounts, not IAM users (the employees).

When you make a capacity decision before you deploy a system, you might end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with the performance implications of limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems can go away. You can use as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down automatically.</p><p>2- Test systems at production scale: In the cloud, you can create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete your testing, and then decommission the resources. Because you only pay for the test environment when it's running, you can simulate your live environment for a fraction of the cost of testing on premises.</p><p>3- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier: Automation allows you to create and replicate your systems at low cost and avoid the expense of manual effort. You can track changes to your automation, audit the impact, and revert to previous parameters when necessary.</p><p>4- Allow for evolutionary architectures: Allow for evolutionary architectures. In a traditional environment, architectural decisions are often implemented as static, one-time events, with a few major versions of a system during its lifetime. As a business and its context continue to change, these initial decisions might hinder the system's ability to deliver changing business requirements. In the cloud, the capability to automate and test on demand lowers the risk of impact from design changes. This allows systems to evolve over time so that businesses can take advantage of innovations as a standard practice.</p><p>5- Drive architectures using data: In the cloud you can collect data on how your architectural choices affect the behavior of your workload. This lets you make fact-based decisions on how to improve your workload. Your cloud infrastructure is code, so you can use that data to inform your architecture choices and improvements over time.</p><p>6- Improve through game days: Test how your architecture and processes perform by regularly scheduling game days to simulate events in production. This will help you understand where improvements can be made and can help develop organizational experience in dealing with events.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Provision a large compute capacity to handle any spikes in load\" is incorrect. </em></strong>Instead of provisioning a large compute capacity to handle the spikes in load, it is recommended to use the AWS Auto Scaling service to add or remove instances based on demand.

When demand drops, AWS Auto Scaling will automatically remove any excess resource capacity, so you avoid overspending.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Use AWS reservations to reduce costs when testing your production environment\" is incorrect. </em></strong>Reservations in AWS are not an appropriate choice when you need to test your production environment, AWS reservations have a minimum term of one year.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Invest heavily in architecting your environment, as it is not easy to change your design later\" is incorrect.</em></strong> In AWS, you can test and provision your resources on-demand and pay only for what you use with no long-term contracts.

This means that IT systems should be designed in a way that reduces interdependencies—a change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components.

The best way to understand and avoid the single point of failure is to begin by making a list of all major points of your architecture. You need to break the points down and understand them further.

Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For example, a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is categorized as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and requires the customer to perform all of the configuration and management tasks.

This means restricting the type of traffic that can reach your applications. Configuring security groups and network ACLs in Amazon VPC is an effective tool to help filter traffic, and reduce the attack surface of your applications.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Security groups allow you to control inbound and outbound traffic to your Amazon EC2 instances by specifically allowing communication only on the ports and protocols required for your applications.

This is useful for allowing or denying traffic at a subnet level, as opposed to security groups that filter traffic at an EC2 instance level.

You can remove single points of failure by assuming everything will fail and designing your architecture to automatically detect and react to failures. For example, configuring and deploying an auto-scaling group of EC2 instances will ensure that if one or more of the instances crashes, Auto-scaling will automatically replace them with new instances. You should also introduce redundancy to remove single points of failure, by deploying your application across multiple Availability Zones.

In order to reduce your Amazon S3 costs, you should create a lifecycle policy to automatically move old (or infrequently accessed) files to less expensive storage tiers such as Amazon Glacier, or to automatically delete them after a specified duration. Similarly, you can create an Amazon EFS lifecycle policy to automatically move less frequently accessed data to less expensive storage tiers such as Amazon EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (EFS Standard-IA) and Amazon EFS One Zone-Infrequent Access (EFS One Zone-IA). Amazon EFS Infrequent Access storage classes provide price/performance that is cost-optimized for files not accessed every day, with storage prices <strong>up to 92% lower</strong> compared to Amazon EFS Standard (EFS Standard) and Amazon EFS One Zone (EFS One Zone) storage classes respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Removing all of your Cost Allocation Tags\" is incorrect. </em></strong>A tag is a label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource.

(Choose TWO)</p>","explanation":"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:</p><p>1- Democratize advanced technologies: Technologies that are difficult to implement can become easier to consume by pushing that knowledge and complexity into the cloud vendor's domain. Rather than having your IT team learns how to host and run a new technology, they can simply consume it as a service. For example, NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning are all technologies that require expertise that is not evenly dispersed across the technical community. In the cloud, these technologies become services that your team can consume while focusing on product development rather than resource provisioning and management.</p><p>2- Go global in minutes: Easily deploy your system in multiple Regions around the world with just a few clicks. This allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.</p><p>3- Use serverless architectures: In the cloud, serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain servers to carry out traditional compute activities. For example, storage services can act as static websites, removing the need for web servers, and event services can host your code for you. This not only removes the operational burden of managing these servers, but also can lower transactional costs because these managed services operate at cloud scale.</p><p>4- Experiment more often: With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.</p><p>5- Mechanical sympathy: Use the technology approach that aligns best to what you are trying to achieve. For example, consider data access patterns when selecting database or storage approaches.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Other options presented are related to security not performance.</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/wellarchitected-framework.pdf\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/wellarchitected-framework.pdf</a></p>","answers":["<p>Apply security at all layers</p>","<p>Use serverless architectures </p>","<p>​ Enable audit logging</p>","<p>Build multi-region architectures to better serve global customers</p>","<p>​ Implement strong Identity and Access controls</p>"],"relatedLectureIds":""},"correct_response":["b","d"],"section":"AWS Best Practices & Design Principles","question_plain":"​ Which design principles relate to performance efficiency in AWS?

Which of the following allows the company to restrict what services and actions are allowed in each individual account?</p>","explanation":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AWS Organizations provides central governance and management across multiple AWS accounts. AWS Service Control Policies (or AWS Organizations Policies) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions for all accounts in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all member accounts in your organization. SCPs help you to ensure member accounts stay within your organization's access control guidelines. In SCPs, you can restrict which AWS services, resources, and individual API actions the users and roles in each member account can access. When AWS Organizations blocks access to a service, resource, or API action for a member account, a user or role in that account cannot access it. This block remains in effect even if an administrator of a member account explicitly grants such permissions in an IAM policy.</p><p>Additional information:</p><p><strong>What is the difference between an AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP) and an IAM policy?</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An IAM policy provides granular control over what users and roles in individual accounts can do. AWS Organizations expands that control to the account level by giving you control over what users and roles in an account or a group of accounts can do. The resulting permissions are the logical intersection of what is allowed by AWS Organizations at the account level and the permissions that are explicitly granted by IAM at the user or role level within that account. In other words, the user can access only what is allowed by both the AWS Organizations policies and IAM policies. If either blocks an operation, the user can't access that operation. For example, if an SCP applied to an account states that the only actions allowed are Amazon EC2 actions, and the permissions on a principal (IAM user or role) in the same AWS account allow both EC2 actions and Amazon S3 actions, the principal is able to access only the EC2 actions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“IAM Policies” is incorrect. </em></strong>IAM Policies cannot be used to manage access across multiple AWS accounts.

You can define your entire workload (applications, infrastructure) as code and update it with code. You can implement your operations procedures as code and automate their execution by triggering them in response to events. By performing operations as code, you limit human error and enable consistent responses to events.</p><p><strong>2- Make frequent, small, reversible changes:</strong> Design workloads to allow components to be updated regularly. Make changes in small increments that can be reversed if they fail (without affecting customers when possible).</p><p><strong>3- Refine operations procedures frequently:</strong> As you use operations procedures, look for opportunities to improve them. As you evolve your workload, evolve your procedures appropriately. Set up regular game days to review and validate that all procedures are effective and that teams are familiar with them.</p><p><strong>4- Anticipate failure:</strong> Perform \"pre-mortem\" exercises to identify potential sources of failure so that they can be removed or mitigated. Test your failure scenarios and validate your understanding of their impact. Test your response procedures to ensure that they are effective, and that teams are familiar with their execution. Set up regular game days to test workloads and team responses to simulated events.</p><p><strong>5- Learn from all operational failures:</strong> Drive improvement through lessons learned from all operational events and failures.

You can configure your workload to monitor logs and metrics and send notifications when thresholds are crossed or significant events occur. Monitoring enables your workload to recognize when low-performance thresholds are crossed or failures occur, so it can recover automatically in response. For example, AWS Elastic Load Balancing offers health-checking capabilities that can validate the health of compute components using a variety of network protocols (i.e., TCP, HTTP, HTTPS, and SSL).

IAM roles allow you to delegate access (for a limited time) to users, applications or services that normally don't have access to your AWS resources. For example, you might want to grant users in your AWS account access to resources they don't usually have, or grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another account. Or you might want to allow a mobile app to use AWS resources. Sometimes you want to give AWS access to users who already have identities defined outside of AWS, such as in your corporate directory. Or, you might want to grant access to your account to third parties so that they can perform an audit on your resources. For these scenarios, you can delegate access to AWS resources using an IAM role.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>IAM Users:</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or service that uses it to directly interact with AWS. A primary use for IAM users is to grant individuals access to the AWS Management Console for interactive tasks and / or to make programmatic requests to AWS services using the API or CLI. A user in AWS consists of a name, a password to sign into the AWS Management Console, and up to two access keys that can be used with the API or CLI.

Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it.

By using AWS, infrastructure costs are converted to a pay-as-you-go model, where customers are charged for the resources that they consume, and those costs are incurred as operating costs instead of as capital expenditures.</p><p><strong>2- Benefit from massive economies of scale:</strong> By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers are aggregated in the cloud, providers such as Amazon Web Services can achieve higher economies of scale which translates into lower pay as you go prices.</p><p><strong>3- Stop guessing capacity:</strong> Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often either end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes notice.</p><p><strong>4- Increase speed and agility:</strong> In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only ever a click away, which means you reduce the time it takes to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes.

An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.

(Choose TWO)</p>","explanation":"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AWS Cloud includes many design patterns and architectural options that you can apply to a wide variety of use cases. Some key design principles of the AWS Cloud include scalability, disposable resources, automation, loose coupling, managed services instead of servers, and flexible data storage options.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Disposable resources instead of fixed servers: </strong></p><p>When designing for the cloud, you can think of servers and other components as temporary resources that you can provision only when you need them instead of fixed servers that exist all the time. This approach solves many problems that usually appear in traditional, on-premises environments. For example, changes and software patches applied over time to the same (fixed) server can result in untested and heterogeneous configurations across different environments. You can solve this problem in AWS with an immutable infrastructure pattern. With this approach, if a problem happens with a server (EC2 instance), rather than updating, it is replaced with a new server containing the latest patches and configuration. This enables resources to always be in a consistent (and tested) state and makes rollbacks easier to perform.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Loose coupling:</strong></p><p>Loose coupling is an approach that involves interconnecting the components in a system or network so that those components depend on each other to the least extent practical. Engineers should architect their systems and applications such that failure in one component does not negatively affect other components. Loosely coupled components make the system resilient and allow it to recover gracefully from failure.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Servers instead of managed services\" is incorrect. </em></strong>AWS&nbsp;recommend the use of managed services instead of servers where possible. AWS offers a broad set of compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster and lower IT costs. Architectures that do not leverage that breadth (e.g., if they use only Amazon EC2) might not be making the most of cloud computing and might be missing an opportunity to increase developer productivity and operational efficiency. AWS managed services provide building blocks that developers can consume to power their applications. These managed services include databases, machine learning, analytics, queuing, search, email, notifications, and more. For example, with Amazon SQS you can offload the administrative burden of operating a highly available, scalable messaging cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use. The same applies to Amazon S3, which enables you to store as much data as you want and access it when you need it, without having to think about capacity, hard disk configurations, replication, and other administrative issues. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Reserved capacity instead of on demand\" is incorrect.</em></strong> Each instance pricing model has has its own use case.

While Dedicated instances also run on dedicated hardware, Dedicated Hosts provide further visibility and control by allowing you to place your instances on a specific, physical server. This enables you to deploy instances using configurations that help address corporate compliance and regulatory requirements.<br></p><p>Note:</p><p>Amazon EC2 purchasing options include: On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated instances.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dedicated Instances also provides Hardware isolation. Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer.

For that reason, Dedicated Hosts is a better option to handle compliance and regulatory requirements in most scenarios.</p><p><br></p><p>2- Dedicated Hosts enable you to benefit from the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model for almost every BYOL scenario, while only certain scenarios are supported by Dedicated Instances. The BYOL model enables AWS customers to use their <strong>existing</strong> server-bound software licenses, including Windows Server, SQL Server, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.

As a result, requests travel a short distance, improving performance for your end-users.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; \"Increases application availability by caching at the edge\" is correct. Web applications often need to contend with spikes in traffic during peak periods of activity. By using Amazon CloudFront, you can cache your content in CloudFront’s edge locations worldwide and reduce the workload on your origin by only fetching content from your origin when needed. This reduced workload on your origin helps you increase the availability of your application.</p><p>Note: An origin server is the server that holds the original, definitive versions of your content.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Simplifies online data migrations from on-premises data centers to AWS\" is incorrect.</em></strong> Amazon CloudFront is not for online data migrations.<strong><em> </em></strong>Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network.

AWS DataSync reduces the complexity and cost of online data transfer, making it simple to transfer datasets between on-premises storage systems and AWS Storage services, and between AWS Storage services. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Enables faster disaster recovery\" is incorrect.</em></strong> CloudFront is not used for disaster recovery. It is used to serve content with low latency by caching copies of objects close to your end-users.</p><p>Disaster recovery is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster. Any event that has a negative impact on your business continuity or finances could be termed a disaster. This could be hardware or software failure, a network outage, a power outage, physical damage to a building like fire or flooding, human error, or some other significant disaster. In AWS, customers have the flexibility to choose the right approach that fits their budget. The approaches could be as minimum as backup and restore from the cloud or full-scale multi-site solution deployed in onsite and AWS with data replication and mirroring.

Elastic Load Balancing can detect the health of Amazon EC2 instances. When it detects unhealthy Amazon EC2 instances, it no longer routes traffic to those unhealthy instances. Instead, it spreads the load across the remaining healthy instances. If all of your Amazon EC2 instances in a particular Availability Zone are unhealthy, but you have set up instances in multiple Availability Zones, Elastic Load Balancing will route traffic to your healthy Amazon EC2 instances in those other zones. It will resume load balancing to the original Amazon EC2 instances when they have been restored to a healthy state. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also, using Auto Scaling enables you to reduce the amount of time and resources you need to monitor your servers – if a failure occurs, a replacement will be automatically launched for you.

On-premises deployment does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing but is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Iaas, PaaS, and SaaS are not deployment models. They represent the different use cases of Cloud Computing, and the different levels of control customers need over their IT resources.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>IaaS is incorrect. </em></strong>Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>PaaS is incorrect. </em></strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS) removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>SaaS - </em></strong>Software as a Service (SaaS) provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece software. A common example of a SaaS application is the web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.</p><p> </p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/</a></p>","relatedLectureIds":""},"correct_response":["d"],"section":"Cloud Computing Models","question_plain":"Which of the following Cloud Computing deployment models eliminates the need to run and maintain physical data centers?","related_lectures":[]},{"_class":"assessment","id":51981718,"assessment_type":"multi-select","prompt":{"question":"<p>What does Amazon GuardDuty do to protect AWS accounts and workloads?

Amazon GuardDuty integrates with Amazon CloudWatch Events and AWS Lambda to allow you to <strong>set up automated remediation actions</strong> against discovered security issues.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the cloud, the collection and aggregation of account and network activities is simplified, but it can be time-consuming for security teams to continuously analyze event log data for potential threats. GuardDuty analyzes tens of billions of events across multiple AWS data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. With GuardDuty, you now have an intelligent and cost-effective option for continuous threat detection in the AWS Cloud. The service uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify and prioritize potential threats.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amazon GuardDuty provides broad protection of your AWS accounts, workloads, and data by helping to identify threats such as attacker reconnaissance, instance compromise, and account compromise.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\" Helps AWS customers identify the root cause of potential security issues\" is incorrect.</em></strong> Amazon Detective is the service that helps AWS customers analyze, investigate, and quickly identify the root cause of potential security issues or suspicious activities.</p><p>How does Amazon Detective differ from Amazon GuardDuty?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amazon GuardDuty is helpful in alerting you when something is wrong and pointing out where to go to fix it. But sometimes, there might be a security finding where you need to dig a lot deeper and analyze more information to isolate the root cause and take action.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amazon Detective simplifies this process by enabling you to easily investigate and quickly get to the root cause of a security finding. Amazon Detective analyzes trillions of events from multiple data sources such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail logs, and automatically creates a unified view of user and resource interactions over time, with all the context and details in one place to help you quickly analyze and get to the root cause of a security finding.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For example, an Amazon GuardDuty finding, like an unusual Console Login API call, can be quickly investigated in Amazon Detective with details about the API call trends over time, and user login attempts on a geolocation map. These details enable you to quickly identify if you think it is legitimate or an indication of a compromised AWS resource.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Checks security groups for rules that allow unrestricted access to AWS resources” is incorrect. </em></strong>Security Groups Check is one of the core security checks provided by AWS Trusted Advisor. AWS Trusted Advisor continuously checks security groups for rules that allow unrestricted access to AWS resources.

AWS addresses many different types of potentially abusive activity such as phishing, malware, spam, and denial of service (DoS)/ distributed denial of service (DDoS) incidents. When abuse is reported, AWS alerts customers so they can take the necessary remediation action. AWS Health Dashboard can also help customers build automation for handling abuse events and the actions to remediate them.</p><p>When customers receive abuse notifications via email only, it is challenging to manage the alerts because emails could be lost or could be sent to incorrect contacts on the account, or they might not be reviewed in a timely manner.

Integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action.</p><p>3- Apply security at all layers: Rather than just focusing on protection of a single outer layer, apply a defense-in-depth approach with other security controls. Apply to all layers (e.g., edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer, every instance, operating system, and application).</p><p>4- Automate security best practices: Automated software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.</p><p>5- Protect data in transit and at rest: Classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate.</p><p>6- Keep people away from data: Create mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This reduces the risk of loss or modification and human error when handling sensitive data.</p><p>7- Prepare for security events: Prepare for an incident by having an incident management process that aligns to your organizational requirements.
