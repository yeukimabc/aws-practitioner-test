Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area. Each AWS Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. Availability Zones in a region are connected with low latency, high throughput, and highly redundant networking. These Availability Zones offer AWS customers an easier and more effective way to design and operate applications and databases, making them more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single datacenter infrastructures or multi-datacenter infrastructures.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to replicating applications and data across multiple data centers in the same Region using Availability Zones, you can also choose to increase redundancy and fault tolerance further by replicating data between geographic Regions (especially if you are serving customers from all over the world).

What does AWS provide to help organize them into teams and then assign the appropriate permissions for each team?</p>","relatedLectureIds":"","feedbacks":["","","",""],"explanation":"<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users that are managed as a unit. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. For example, you could have a user group called Admins and give that user group the types of permissions that administrators typically need. Any user in that user group automatically has the permissions that are assigned to the user group. If a new user joins your organization and needs administrator privileges, you can assign the appropriate permissions by adding the user to that user group. Similarly, if a person changes jobs in your organization, instead of editing that user's permissions, you can remove him or her from the old user groups and add him or her to the appropriate new user groups.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"IAM role\"&nbsp;is incorrect. </em></strong>An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. IAM roles allow you to delegate access (for a limited time) to users or services that normally don't have access to your organization's AWS resources. IAM users or AWS services can assume a role to obtain temporary security credentials that can be used to interact with specific AWS resources.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don't normally have access to your AWS resources. For example, you might want to grant users in your AWS account access to resources they don't usually have, or grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another account. Or you might want to allow a mobile app to use AWS resources, but not want to embed AWS keys within the app. Sometimes you want to give AWS access to users who already have identities defined outside of AWS, such as in your corporate directory. Or, you might want to grant access to your account to third parties so that they can perform an audit on your resources. For these scenarios, you can delegate access to AWS resources using an IAM role.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"IAM users\"&nbsp;is incorrect. </em></strong>An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to directly interact with AWS. A primary use for IAM users is to give people the ability to sign in to the AWS Management Console for interactive tasks and to make programmatic requests to AWS services using the API or CLI. A user in AWS consists of a name, a password to sign into the AWS Management Console, and up to two access keys that can be used with the API or CLI. When you create an IAM user, you grant it permissions by making it a member of a user group that has appropriate permission policies attached (recommended), or by directly attaching policies to the user.</p><p><br></p><p>Additional information:</p><p>An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone (or any service, application, ...etc) who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session. IAM roles are meant to be assumed by authorized entities, such as IAM users, applications, or an AWS service such as Amazon EC2.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"AWS Organizations\" is incorrect. </em></strong>AWS Organizations can be used to group AWS accounts, not IAM users (the employees).

When you make a capacity decision before you deploy a system, you might end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with the performance implications of limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems can go away. You can use as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down automatically.</p><p>2- Test systems at production scale: In the cloud, you can create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete your testing, and then decommission the resources. Because you only pay for the test environment when it's running, you can simulate your live environment for a fraction of the cost of testing on premises.</p><p>3- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier: Automation allows you to create and replicate your systems at low cost and avoid the expense of manual effort. You can track changes to your automation, audit the impact, and revert to previous parameters when necessary.</p><p>4- Allow for evolutionary architectures: Allow for evolutionary architectures. In a traditional environment, architectural decisions are often implemented as static, one-time events, with a few major versions of a system during its lifetime. As a business and its context continue to change, these initial decisions might hinder the system's ability to deliver changing business requirements. In the cloud, the capability to automate and test on demand lowers the risk of impact from design changes. This allows systems to evolve over time so that businesses can take advantage of innovations as a standard practice.</p><p>5- Drive architectures using data: In the cloud you can collect data on how your architectural choices affect the behavior of your workload. This lets you make fact-based decisions on how to improve your workload. Your cloud infrastructure is code, so you can use that data to inform your architecture choices and improvements over time.</p><p>6- Improve through game days: Test how your architecture and processes perform by regularly scheduling game days to simulate events in production. This will help you understand where improvements can be made and can help develop organizational experience in dealing with events.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Provision a large compute capacity to handle any spikes in load\" is incorrect. </em></strong>Instead of provisioning a large compute capacity to handle the spikes in load, it is recommended to use the AWS Auto Scaling service to add or remove instances based on demand.

This means that IT systems should be designed in a way that reduces interdependencies—a change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components.

The best way to understand and avoid the single point of failure is to begin by making a list of all major points of your architecture. You need to break the points down and understand them further.

Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For example, a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is categorized as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and requires the customer to perform all of the configuration and management tasks.

This means restricting the type of traffic that can reach your applications. Configuring security groups and network ACLs in Amazon VPC is an effective tool to help filter traffic, and reduce the attack surface of your applications.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Security groups allow you to control inbound and outbound traffic to your Amazon EC2 instances by specifically allowing communication only on the ports and protocols required for your applications.

This is useful for allowing or denying traffic at a subnet level, as opposed to security groups that filter traffic at an EC2 instance level.

You can remove single points of failure by assuming everything will fail and designing your architecture to automatically detect and react to failures. For example, configuring and deploying an auto-scaling group of EC2 instances will ensure that if one or more of the instances crashes, Auto-scaling will automatically replace them with new instances. You should also introduce redundancy to remove single points of failure, by deploying your application across multiple Availability Zones.

In order to reduce your Amazon S3 costs, you should create a lifecycle policy to automatically move old (or infrequently accessed) files to less expensive storage tiers such as Amazon Glacier, or to automatically delete them after a specified duration. Similarly, you can create an Amazon EFS lifecycle policy to automatically move less frequently accessed data to less expensive storage tiers such as Amazon EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (EFS Standard-IA) and Amazon EFS One Zone-Infrequent Access (EFS One Zone-IA). Amazon EFS Infrequent Access storage classes provide price/performance that is cost-optimized for files not accessed every day, with storage prices <strong>up to 92% lower</strong> compared to Amazon EFS Standard (EFS Standard) and Amazon EFS One Zone (EFS One Zone) storage classes respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Removing all of your Cost Allocation Tags\" is incorrect. </em></strong>A tag is a label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource.

(Choose TWO)</p>","explanation":"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:</p><p>1- Democratize advanced technologies: Technologies that are difficult to implement can become easier to consume by pushing that knowledge and complexity into the cloud vendor's domain. Rather than having your IT team learns how to host and run a new technology, they can simply consume it as a service. For example, NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning are all technologies that require expertise that is not evenly dispersed across the technical community. In the cloud, these technologies become services that your team can consume while focusing on product development rather than resource provisioning and management.</p><p>2- Go global in minutes: Easily deploy your system in multiple Regions around the world with just a few clicks. This allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.</p><p>3- Use serverless architectures: In the cloud, serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain servers to carry out traditional compute activities. For example, storage services can act as static websites, removing the need for web servers, and event services can host your code for you. This not only removes the operational burden of managing these servers, but also can lower transactional costs because these managed services operate at cloud scale.</p><p>4- Experiment more often: With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.</p><p>5- Mechanical sympathy: Use the technology approach that aligns best to what you are trying to achieve. For example, consider data access patterns when selecting database or storage approaches.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Other options presented are related to security not performance.</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/wellarchitected-framework.pdf\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/wellarchitected-framework.pdf</a></p>","answers":["<p>Apply security at all layers</p>","<p>Use serverless architectures </p>","<p>​ Enable audit logging</p>","<p>Build multi-region architectures to better serve global customers</p>","<p>​ Implement strong Identity and Access controls</p>"],"relatedLectureIds":""},"correct_response":["b","d"],"section":"AWS Best Practices & Design Principles","question_plain":"​ Which design principles relate to performance efficiency in AWS?

Server-side encryption is transparent to the end user. AWS generates a unique encryption key for each object, and then encrypts the object using AES-256.</p><p>5- Encryption – client side: With client-side encryption you create and manage your own encryption keys. Keys you create are not exported to AWS in clear text. Your applications encrypt data before submitting it to Amazon S3, and decrypt data after receiving it from Amazon S3. Data is stored in an encrypted form, with keys and algorithms only known to you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Additional information: (IMPORTANT)</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AWS also provides a fully managed security service called AWS Macie to help protect your sensitive data in Amazon S3.

Amazon Macie recognizes sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) or intellectual property, and provides you with dashboards and alerts that give visibility into how this data is being accessed or moved. The fully managed service continuously monitors data access activity for anomalies, and generates detailed alerts when it detects risk of unauthorized access or inadvertent data leaks.

AWS Service Control Policies (or AWS Organizations Policies) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions for all accounts in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all member accounts in your organization. SCPs help you to ensure member accounts stay within your organization's access control guidelines. In SCPs, you can restrict which AWS services, resources, and individual API actions the users and roles in each member account can access. When AWS Organizations blocks access to a service, resource, or API action for a member account, a user or role in that account cannot access it.

The resulting permissions are the logical intersection of what is allowed by AWS Organizations at the account level and the permissions that are explicitly granted by IAM at the user or role level within that account. In other words, the user can access only what is allowed by both the AWS Organizations policies and IAM policies. If either blocks an operation, the user can't access that operation. For example, if an SCP applied to an account states that the only actions allowed are Amazon EC2 actions, and the permissions on a principal (IAM user or role) in the same AWS account allow both EC2 actions and Amazon S3 actions, the principal is able to access only the EC2 actions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“IAM Policies” is incorrect. </em></strong>IAM Policies cannot be used to manage access across multiple AWS accounts.

You can define your entire workload (applications, infrastructure) as code and update it with code. You can implement your operations procedures as code and automate their execution by triggering them in response to events. By performing operations as code, you limit human error and enable consistent responses to events.</p><p><strong>2- Make frequent, small, reversible changes:</strong> Design workloads to allow components to be updated regularly. Make changes in small increments that can be reversed if they fail (without affecting customers when possible).</p><p><strong>3- Refine operations procedures frequently:</strong> As you use operations procedures, look for opportunities to improve them. As you evolve your workload, evolve your procedures appropriately.

Test your failure scenarios and validate your understanding of their impact. Test your response procedures to ensure that they are effective, and that teams are familiar with their execution. Set up regular game days to test workloads and team responses to simulated events.</p><p><strong>5- Learn from all operational failures:</strong> Drive improvement through lessons learned from all operational events and failures.

IAM roles allow you to delegate access (for a limited time) to users, applications or services that normally don't have access to your AWS resources. For example, you might want to grant users in your AWS account access to resources they don't usually have, or grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another account. Or you might want to allow a mobile app to use AWS resources. Sometimes you want to give AWS access to users who already have identities defined outside of AWS, such as in your corporate directory. Or, you might want to grant access to your account to third parties so that they can perform an audit on your resources. For these scenarios, you can delegate access to AWS resources using an IAM role.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>IAM Users:</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or service that uses it to directly interact with AWS. A primary use for IAM users is to grant individuals access to the AWS Management Console for interactive tasks and / or to make programmatic requests to AWS services using the API or CLI. A user in AWS consists of a name, a password to sign into the AWS Management Console, and up to two access keys that can be used with the API or CLI. When you create an IAM user, you grant it permissions by making it a member of a user group that has appropriate permission policies attached (recommended), or by directly attaching policies to the user. </p><p><br></p><p>Additional information:</p><p>An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone (or any service, application, ...etc) who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.

By using AWS, infrastructure costs are converted to a pay-as-you-go model, where customers are charged for the resources that they consume, and those costs are incurred as operating costs instead of as capital expenditures.</p><p><strong>2- Benefit from massive economies of scale:</strong> By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers are aggregated in the cloud, providers such as Amazon Web Services can achieve higher economies of scale which translates into lower pay as you go prices.</p><p><strong>3- Stop guessing capacity:</strong> Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often either end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes notice.</p><p><strong>4- Increase speed and agility:</strong> In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only ever a click away, which means you reduce the time it takes to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.</p><p><strong>5- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers:</strong> Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking and powering servers.</p><p><strong>6- Go global in minutes: </strong>Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide a lower latency and better experience for your customers simply and at minimal cost.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Eliminates the need to monitor servers and applications\" is incorrect. </em></strong>Using AWS does not eliminate the need to monitor servers and applications.

An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.

With this approach, if a problem happens with a server (EC2 instance), rather than updating, it is replaced with a new server containing the latest patches and configuration. This enables resources to always be in a consistent (and tested) state and makes rollbacks easier to perform.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Loose coupling:</strong></p><p>Loose coupling is an approach that involves interconnecting the components in a system or network so that those components depend on each other to the least extent practical. Engineers should architect their systems and applications such that failure in one component does not negatively affect other components. Loosely coupled components make the system resilient and allow it to recover gracefully from failure.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Servers instead of managed services\" is incorrect. </em></strong>AWS&nbsp;recommend the use of managed services instead of servers where possible. AWS offers a broad set of compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster and lower IT costs. Architectures that do not leverage that breadth (e.g., if they use only Amazon EC2) might not be making the most of cloud computing and might be missing an opportunity to increase developer productivity and operational efficiency. AWS managed services provide building blocks that developers can consume to power their applications. These managed services include databases, machine learning, analytics, queuing, search, email, notifications, and more. For example, with Amazon SQS you can offload the administrative burden of operating a highly available, scalable messaging cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use. The same applies to Amazon S3, which enables you to store as much data as you want and access it when you need it, without having to think about capacity, hard disk configurations, replication, and other administrative issues. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\"Reserved capacity instead of on demand\" is incorrect.</em></strong> Each instance pricing model has has its own use case.

How can you meet this requirement?</p>","explanation":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When you launch instances on a Dedicated Host, the instances run on a physical server that is dedicated for your use. While Dedicated instances also run on dedicated hardware, Dedicated Hosts provide further visibility and control by allowing you to place your instances on a specific, physical server. This enables you to deploy instances using configurations that help address corporate compliance and regulatory requirements.<br></p><p>Note:</p><p>Amazon EC2 purchasing options include: On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated instances.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dedicated Instances also provides Hardware isolation. Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer.

(Choose TWO)</p>","feedbacks":["","","","",""],"explanation":"<p><strong>\"Improves Fault-Tolerance\" is a correct answer.</strong> AWS has unique set of services that you can use to build fault-tolerant applications in the cloud. For example you can get improved fault tolerance by placing your compute instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer, as it can automatically balance traffic across multiple instances and multiple Availability Zones and ensure that only healthy Amazon EC2 instances receive traffic. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can setup an Elastic Load Balancer to balance incoming application traffic across Amazon EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone or multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing can detect the health of Amazon EC2 instances. When it detects unhealthy Amazon EC2 instances, it no longer routes traffic to those unhealthy instances. Instead, it spreads the load across the remaining healthy instances.

Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>PaaS is incorrect. </em></strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS) removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>SaaS - </em></strong>Software as a Service (SaaS) provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece software.

GuardDuty analyzes tens of billions of events across multiple AWS data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. With GuardDuty, you now have an intelligent and cost-effective option for continuous threat detection in the AWS Cloud. The service uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify and prioritize potential threats.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amazon GuardDuty provides broad protection of your AWS accounts, workloads, and data by helping to identify threats such as attacker reconnaissance, instance compromise, and account compromise.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>The other options are incorrect:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>\" Helps AWS customers identify the root cause of potential security issues\" is incorrect.</em></strong> Amazon Detective is the service that helps AWS customers analyze, investigate, and quickly identify the root cause of potential security issues or suspicious activities.</p><p>How does Amazon Detective differ from Amazon GuardDuty?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amazon GuardDuty is helpful in alerting you when something is wrong and pointing out where to go to fix it. But sometimes, there might be a security finding where you need to dig a lot deeper and analyze more information to isolate the root cause and take action.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amazon Detective simplifies this process by enabling you to easily investigate and quickly get to the root cause of a security finding. Amazon Detective analyzes trillions of events from multiple data sources such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail logs, and automatically creates a unified view of user and resource interactions over time, with all the context and details in one place to help you quickly analyze and get to the root cause of a security finding.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For example, an Amazon GuardDuty finding, like an unusual Console Login API call, can be quickly investigated in Amazon Detective with details about the API call trends over time, and user login attempts on a geolocation map. These details enable you to quickly identify if you think it is legitimate or an indication of a compromised AWS resource.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>“Checks security groups for rules that allow unrestricted access to AWS resources” is incorrect. </em></strong>Security Groups Check is one of the core security checks provided by AWS Trusted Advisor.

When abuse is reported, AWS alerts customers so they can take the necessary remediation action. AWS Health Dashboard can also help customers build automation for handling abuse events and the actions to remediate them.</p><p>When customers receive abuse notifications via email only, it is challenging to manage the alerts because emails could be lost or could be sent to incorrect contacts on the account, or they might not be reviewed in a timely manner.
